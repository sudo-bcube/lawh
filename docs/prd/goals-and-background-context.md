# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch Lawh MVP by February 14, 2026 that enables Muslims to identify Quranic verses from live recitations within seconds
- Achieve 85%+ verse identification accuracy (correct verse in top 3 results) using Speech-to-Text and fuzzy matching
- Acquire 1,000 active users within first 30 days post-launch through targeted marketing ($200 budget)
- Validate cost sustainability by monitoring Azure STT costs against freemium subscription revenue ($1/month or $10/year via RevenueCat)
- Collect 5,000+ user searches with feedback to continuously improve matching algorithm
- Deliver a privacy-first, culturally respectful user experience that builds trust within the Muslim community

## Background Context

Muslims worldwide hear beautiful Quranic recitations at mosques, during prayers, at religious lectures, and especially during Hajj and Umrah—but often cannot identify which verses are being recited in the moment. This "memory gap" (remembering the sound but not the reference) breaks spiritual connection and prevents deeper engagement with the Quran. Current solutions—manual searching, asking others, or giving up—all fail to solve the core problem of immediate verse identification.

Existing apps like Tarteel AI (1M+ downloads) validate market demand but struggle with verse discovery accuracy. Lawh addresses this gap by using advanced Speech-to-Text with confidence-based fuzzy matching to identify verses from any reciter in real-time. The solution is now technically feasible because Arabic STT has finally reached the accuracy threshold needed for Quranic recitation recognition. The name "Lawh" (meaning "tablet") references Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet), connecting the app's purpose to Islamic tradition.

**Problem Validation Approach:**

This PRD is based on the product owner's personal observations and anecdotal understanding of the problem space rather than formal user research (surveys, interviews, or focus groups). The problem statement represents a **hypothesis to be validated through MVP deployment and user feedback**.

**Validation Criteria:**
- If ≥75% of users provide positive feedback on verse identification accuracy (Goal #2), the problem is validated
- If users return within 7 days at ≥40% rate (Goal #5), the solution provides ongoing value
- If 1,000+ users adopt the app within 30 days (Goal #3), market demand is confirmed

**Risk Acknowledgment:** Without formal user research, there is risk that the assumed problem (inability to identify verses) may not be as widespread or painful as hypothesized. The MVP approach mitigates this risk by enabling rapid validation with minimal investment (4 weeks, $200 marketing budget).
