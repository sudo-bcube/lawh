## 1. General Questions

### What is Lawh?

Lawh is a mobile application that helps you identify Quranic verses by listening to audio recitations. Simply record or upload a recitation, and Lawh will identify the verse for you, displaying the Arabic text, transliteration, and English translation.

### What does "Lawh" mean?

"Lawh" (لَوْح) is an Arabic word meaning "tablet" or "board." It is also referenced in the Quran as "Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz" (اللوح المحفوظ) - the Preserved Tablet, where all divine decrees are written. The name reflects our mission to help preserve and identify the divine words of the Quran.

### Who is Lawh for?

Lawh is designed for:
- **Students of the Quran** who want to identify verses they hear
- **Memorizers (Huffaz)** looking for a quick reference tool
- **Teachers and scholars** who need to verify verse references

## 2. How It Works

### How does verse identification work?

1. **Record or upload** an audio clip of Quranic recitation
2. Our **AI-powered voice recognition** technology transcribes the Arabic audio
3. Our **matching algorithm** searches through all 6,236 verses of the Quran
4. **Results are displayed** showing the matching verse(s) with Arabic text, transliteration, and translation

### How accurate is the verse identification?

Our system achieves high accuracy for clear recordings. Accuracy depends on:
- **Audio quality:** Clearer recordings yield better results
- **Background noise:** Minimal background noise improves accuracy
- **Recitation style:** Standard Tajweed recitation works best
- **Recording length:** Longer recordings (5-10 seconds) provide more context

We continuously improve our algorithms based on user feedback.

### What if the app doesn't find a match?

If no match is found, it could be due to:
- Poor audio quality
- Excessive background noise
- Very short recording
- Non-Quranic audio content

Try recording again in a quieter environment with clearer audio. You can also use the "No Match" feedback option to help us improve.

### Can I use Lawh offline?

- **Quran Reader:** Works offline (content is stored locally)
- **Verse Identification:** Requires an internet connection for audio processing

### What recitation styles does Lawh support?

Lawh supports all standard Quranic recitation styles. The AI is trained on diverse recitation samples and can recognize:
- Different qira'at (recitation methods)
- Various reciters' voices
- Different speeds of recitation

### How long should my recording be?

For best results:
- **Minimum:** 3-5 seconds
- **Recommended:** 5-10 seconds
- **Maximum:** 30 seconds

Longer recordings provide more context and typically yield more accurate results.

## 6. Religious and Accuracy Concerns

### Is the Quranic text in Lawh authentic?

Yes. We use the Quranic text from the **Tanzil Project** (https://tanzil.net), a highly respected and verified digital Quran source. The text uses the Uthmani script and has been carefully verified.

**Copyright:** Quran text © Tanzil.net (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License)

### Can I rely on Lawh for religious study?

Lawh is a **technological tool** to assist in Quranic study. We recommend:
- Verifying important matters with qualified scholars
- Using Lawh as a supplement to, not replacement for, traditional learning
- Cross-referencing with authentic printed Quran copies
- Seeking formal Tajweed instruction for proper recitation

### What if the app identifies the wrong verse?

Our matching algorithm strives for accuracy but isn't perfect. If you notice an incorrect match:
1. Tap the **thumbs down** button
2. Optionally provide the correct verse reference
3. Your feedback helps us improve

### Does Lawh replace the need to memorize the Quran?

No. Lawh is a tool to **support** your Quranic journey, not replace traditional memorization (Hifz). We encourage:
- Using Lawh to verify and review what you're learning
- Continuing traditional memorization with qualified teachers
- Using the app as a supplementary resource

### Is it appropriate to use technology for Quran study?

Absolutely. Technology can be a powerful tool for Islamic education when used respectfully. The Quran encourages seeking knowledge through all beneficial means. Lawh is designed to make the Quran more accessible while maintaining the highest respect for the sacred text.

### Are the translations accurate?

We provide translations for reference purposes. Translations are interpretations and cannot fully capture the Arabic original. For scholarly or religious rulings, always refer to the Arabic text and consult qualified scholars.

## 7. Account and Access

### Do I need to create an account?

Yes, you can install Lawh on multiple devices. However:
- Each device has its own search history
- Premium subscription transfers if you're logged into the same Apple ID or Google account

2. Go to Settings
3. View your subscription status
